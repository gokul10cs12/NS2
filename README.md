Ns2 simulators

Tasks:

a) Simple Wi-Fi: 

Create a Wi-Fi network - Simulate a Wi-Fi network with a single access point(AP) and a variable number of clients, ranging from 1 to 10. Arrange the clients equally spaced on a circle around the AP. For each number of clients, simulate 20 seconds worth of network traffic using the existing parameters. Repeat (or batch) the simulation for 20 trials, using a different seed for the random number generator each time, and compute the average total data delivered to the AP over the 20 simulation runs. Plot this quantity as a function of the number of clients, and describe your findings.


b) Apartment Wi-Fi: 

Create several competing Wi-Fi networks - Building on the previous task, add more Wi-Fi access points with different numbers of users, simulating what you might expect to happen in an apartment complex where each unit has their own Wi-Fi network sharing the same channel. Choose the locations of the multiple APs as you see appropriate for the apartment scenario. Perform a similar study to the previous, but for different numbers or densities of APs in the apartment. Plot your results and describe your findings.
